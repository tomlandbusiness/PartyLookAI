# PartyLookAI
An Open Source Project dedicated to creating a free-to-use AI Art Generator available to aid artists in supporting their creations and vision.

# What does this project do?
This project allows artist, writers, singers, and influencers to create AI Generated art without strings attached. No cost to the user, no legal ties to conflct with the users projects, just AI Generated Art that the user can use at his/her whim.

# Why is this project useful?
Currently, every AI Art Generator requires payment of some form or fashion. That barrier is being lifted so young creators can create to their hearts content.

# How do I get started?
Jump into the code, use lots of comments to communicate your direction to other open source developers, and start coding!

# Where can I get more help, if I need it?
This is my first Open Source Project, so please reach out to my email at anytime - tomlandbusiness@gmail.com




Enjoy!
